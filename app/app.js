      <p class="author">Q: How do you reserve a time slot?</p>
      <p>
        A: Reserving a time slot is not hard at all. First you will select
        what date you want to reserve. Then you will select the time
        frame, anywhere from 15 mins to an entire day. If you want to
        reserve a time slot for longer than a day, you can make multiple
        reservations. Changed your mind? Just press the "Cancel" button
        and you can make a reservation another day.

        BarkMeow prices vary per reservation. It depends on how many
        animals are being watched. It also depends on how long the time
        reservation is for. The longer the time slot and the higher the
        animal count, the higher the price the reservation will be. Don't
        forget to tip your BarkMeow watcher as they receive 100% of it!
